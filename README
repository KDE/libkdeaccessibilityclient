libkdeaccessibilityclient
=========================

This library is used when writing accessibility clients such as screen readers.

Coding style: http://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Kdelibs_Coding_Style
Generally this library follows http://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Library_Code_Policy

Be aware that it is in an early stage of development right now so no compatibility is guaranteered.

The public api should reside in:
src/accessible

The abstraction of DBus and related at-spi tools should go into
src/atspi
but not exported.
